This bibliography was generated for publications by researchers affiliated with the NSF-Census Research Network (NCRN). The list of publications were provided by NCRN node leaders to staff at the Coordinating Office, lead by Lars Vilhuber. The last updates were received and processed in November of 2017; the bibliography thus covers the time period 2011-2017. At the time of last compilation, some articles were still under review, or had just been submitted; the bibliographic information thus may be incomplete. Articles are in alphabetical order of the first author's last name.

\section*{Technical aspects}
