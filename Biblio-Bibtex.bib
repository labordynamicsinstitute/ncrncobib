	title = {Data fusion for  correcting measurement errors},
	year = {Submitted},
	abstract = {Often in surveys, key items are subject to measurement errors. Given just the data, it can be difficult to determine the distribution of this error process, and hence to obtain accurate inferences that involve the error-prone variables. In some settings, however, analysts have access to a data source on different individuals with high quality measurements of the error-prone survey items. We present a data fusion framework for leveraging this information to improve inferences in the error-prone survey. The basic idea is to posit models about the rates at which individuals make errors, coupled with models for the values reported when errors are made. This can avoid the unrealistic assumption of conditional independence typically used in data fusion. We apply the approach on the reported values of educational attainments in the American Community Survey, using the National Survey of College Graduates as the high quality data source. In doing so, we account for the informative sampling design used to select the National Survey of College Graduates. We also present a process for assessing the sensitivity of various analyses to different choices for the measurement error models. Supplemental material is available online.},

	year = {Submitted},
	abstract = {Data stewards seeking to provide access to large-scale social science data face a difficult challenge. They have to share data in ways that protect privacy and confidentiality, are informative for many analyses and purposes, and are relatively straightforward to use by data analysts. We present a framework for addressing this challenge. The framework uses an integrated system that includes fully synthetic data intended for wide access, coupled with means for approved users to access the confidential data via secure remote access solutions, glued together by verification servers that allow users to assess the quality of their analyses with the synthetic data. We apply this framework to data on the careers of employees of the U. S. federal government, studying differentials in pay by race. The integrated system performs as intended, allowing users to explore the synthetic data for potential pay differentials and learn through verifications which findings in the synthetic data hold up in the confidential data and which do not. We find differentials across races; for example, the gap between black and white female federal employees{\textquoteright} pay increased over the time period. We present models for generating synthetic careers and differentially private algorithms for verification of regression results.

	abstract = {In the U.S. Census Bureau{\textquoteright}s 2002 and 2007 Censuses of Manufactures 79\% and 73\% of observations respectively have imputed data for at least one variable used to compute total factor productivity. The Bureau primarily imputes for missing values using mean-imputation methods which can reduce the true underlying variance of the imputed variables. For every variable entering TFP in 2002 and 2007 we show the dispersion is significantly smaller in the Census mean-imputed versus the Census non-imputed data. As an alternative to mean imputation we show how to use classification and regression trees (CART) to allow for a distribution of multiple possible impute values based on other plants that are CART-algorithmically determined to be similar based on other observed variables. For 90\% of the 473 industries in 2002 and the 84\% of the 471 industries in 2007 we find that TFP dispersion increases as we move from Census mean-imputed data to Census non-imputed data to the CART-imputed data.},

The estimated marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is approximately one, a higher estimate than estimates found in less comprehensive or well-measured data. This estimate takes into account the elasticity of demand for gasoline and potential slow adjustment to changes in prices. The high MPC implies that changes in gasoline prices have large aggregate effects.},

	abstract = {Using earnings data from the U.S. Census Bureau, this paper analyzes the role of the employer in explaining the rise in earnings inequality in the United States. We first establish a consistent frame of analysis appropriate for administrative data used to study earnings inequality. We show that the trends in earnings inequality in the administrative data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Program are inconsistent with other data sources when we do not correct for the presence of misused SSNs. After this correction to the worker frame, we analyze how the earnings distribution has changed in the last decade. We present a decomposition of the year-to-year changes in the earnings distribution from 2004-2013. Even when simplifying these flows to movements between the bottom 20\%, the middle 60\% and the top 20\% of the earnings distribution, about 20.5 million workers undergo a transition each year. Another 19.9 million move between employment and nonemployment. To understand the role of the firm in these transitions, we estimate a model for log earnings with additive fixed worker and firm effects using all jobs held by eligible workers from 2004-2013. We construct a composite log earnings firm component across all jobs for a worker in a given year and a non-firm component. We also construct a skill-type index. We show that, while the difference between working at a low- or middle-paying firm are relatively small, the gains from working at a top-paying firm are large. Specifically, the benefits of working for a high-paying firm are not only realized today, through higher earnings paid to the worker, but also persist through an increase in the probability of upward mobility. High-paying firms facilitate moving workers to the top of the earnings distribution and keeping them there.},

information on two overlapping sets of entities. This is non-trivial in the absence
of unique identifiers and it is important for a wide variety of applications given
that it needs to be solved whenever we have to combine information from different
sources. Most statistical techniques currently used for record linkage are derived from
a seminal paper by Fellegi and Sunter (1969). These techniques usually assume independence
in the matching statuses of record pairs to derive estimation procedures
and optimal point estimators. We argue that this independence assumption is unreasonable
and instead target a bipartite matching between the two datafiles as our
parameter of interest. Bayesian implementations allow us to quantify uncertainty on
the matching decisions and derive a variety of point estimators using different loss
functions. We propose partial Bayes estimates that allow uncertain parts of the bipartite
matching to be left unresolved. We evaluate our approach to record linkage
using a variety of challenging scenarios and show that it outperforms the traditional
methodology. We illustrate the advantages of our methods merging two datafiles on

	abstract = {Estimating abundance for multiple populations is of fundamental importance to many ecological monitoring programs. Equally important is quantifying the spatial distribution and characterizing the migratory behavior of target populations within the study domain. To achieve these goals, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical multi-population multistate Jolly-Seber model that incorporates covariates. The model is proposed using a state-space framework and has several distinct advantages. First, multiple populations within the same study area can be modeled simultaneously. As a consequence, it is possible to achieve improved parameter estimation by {\textquotedblleft}borrowing strength{\textquotedblright} across different populations. In many cases, such as our motivating example involving endangered species, this borrowing of strength is crucial, as there is relatively less information for one of the populations under consideration. Second, in addition to accommodating covariate information, we develop a computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that requires no tuning. Importantly, the model we propose allows us to draw inference on each population as well as on multiple populations simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a motivating example of estimating the spatial distribution and migration of hatchery and wild populations of the endangered pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus), using data from the Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment Program on the Lower Missouri River.

	abstract = {Vector autoregressive (VAR) models have become a staple in the analysis of multivariate time series and are formulated in the time domain as difference equations, with an implied covariance structure. In many contexts, it is desirable to work with a stable, or at least stationary, representation. To fit such models, one must impose restrictions on the coefficient matrices to ensure that certain determinants are nonzero; which, except in special cases, may prove burdensome. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose a flexible frequency domain model expressed in terms of the spectral density matrix. Specifically, this paper treats the modeling of covariance stationary vector-valued (i.e., multivariate) time series via an extension of the exponential model for the spectrum of a scalar time series. We discuss the modeling advantages of the vector exponential model and its computational facets, such as how to obtain Wold coefficients from given cepstral coefficients. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approach through simulation as well as two illustrative data examples focusing on multi-step ahead forecasting and estimation of squared coherence.},

	number = {1512.07273},
	year = {2017},
	abstract = {We introduce a Bayesian approach for multivariate spatio-temporal prediction for high-dimensional count-valued data. Our primary interest is when there are possibly millions of data points referenced over different variables, geographic regions, and times. This problem requires extensive methodological advancements, as jointly modeling correlated data of this size leads to the so-called "big n problem." The computational complexity of prediction in this setting is further exacerbated by acknowledging that count-valued data are naturally non-Gaussian. Thus, we develop a new computationally efficient distribution theory for this setting. In particular, we introduce a multivariate log-gamma distribution and provide substantial theoretical development including: results regarding conditional distributions, marginal distributions, an asymptotic relationship with the multivariate normal distribution, and full-conditional distributions for a Gibbs sampler. To incorporate dependence between variables, regions, and time points, a multivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model (MSTM) is used. The results in this manuscript are extremely general, and can be used for data that exhibit fewer sources of dependency than what we consider (e.g., multivariate, spatial-only, or spatio-temporal-only data). Hence, the implications of our modeling framework may have a large impact on the general problem of jointly modeling correlated count-valued data. We show the effectiveness of our approach through a simulation study. Additionally, we demonstrate our proposed methodology with an important application analyzing data obtained from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program, which is administered by the U.S. Census Bureau.},

We describe uses and limitations of cost-benefit analysis in this decision problem in the case of the 2016 Census of South Africa. The government of South Africa needed to decide whether to conduct a 2016 Census or to rely on increasingly inaccurate postcensal estimates accounting for births, deaths, and migration since the previous (2011) Census. The cost-benefit analysis compared predicted costs of the 2016 Census to the benefits of improved allocation of intergovernmental revenue, which was considered by the government to be a critical use of the 2016 Census, although not the only important benefit. Without the 2016 Census, allocations would be based on population estimates. Accuracy of the postcensal estimates was estimated from the performance of past estimates, and the hypothetical expected reduction in errors in allocation due to the 2016 Census was estimated. A loss function was introduced to quantify the improvement in allocation. With this evidence, the government was able to decide not to conduct the 2016 Census, but instead to improve data and capacity for producing post-censal estimates.},

The model assumes that (i) each group is a member of a group-level latent class, and (ii) each unit is a member of a unit-level latent class nested within its group-level latent class. This structure allows the model to capture dependence among units in the same group. It also facilitates simultaneous modeling of variables at both group and unit levels. We develop a version of the model that assigns zero probability to groups and units with physically impossible combinations of variables. We apply the model to estimate multivariate relationships in a subset of the American Community Survey.

	abstract = {Survey interviewers are often tasked with assessing the quality
of respondents{\textquoteright} answers after completing a survey interview. These
interviewer observations have been used to proxy for measurement error
in interviewer-administered surveys. How interviewers formulate these
evaluations and how well they proxy for measurement error has received
little empirical attention. According to dual-process theories of impression
formation, individuals form impressions about others based on the
social categories of the observed person (e.g., sex, race) and individual
behaviors observed during an interaction. Although initial impressions
start with heuristic, rule-of-thumb evaluations, systematic processing is
characterized by extensive incorporation of available evidence. In a survey
context, if interviewers default to heuristic information processing
when evaluating respondent engagement, then we expect their evaluations
to be primarily based on respondent characteristics and stereotypes
associated with those characteristics. Under systematic processing, on the other hand, interviewers process and evaluate respondents based on observable respondent behaviors occurring during the question-answering
process. We use the Work and Leisure Today Survey, including survey
data and behavior codes, to examine proxy measures of heuristic
and systematic processing by interviewers as predictors of interviewer
postsurvey evaluations of respondents{\textquoteright} cooperativeness, interest, friendliness,
and talkativeness. Our results indicate that CATI interviewers
base their evaluations on actual behaviors during an interview (i.e., systematic
processing) rather than perceived characteristics of the respondent

reassuring for the many surveys that collect interviewer observations as

	abstract = {Online surveys have the potential to support adaptive questions, where later questions depend on earlier responses. Past work has taken a rule-based approach, uniformly across all respondents. We envision a richer interpretation of adaptive questions, which we call dynamic question ordering (DQO), where question order is personalized. Such an approach could increase engagement, and therefore response rate, as well as imputation quality. We present a DQO framework to improve survey completion and imputation. In the general survey-taking setting, we want to maximize survey completion, and so we focus on ordering questions to engage the respondent and collect hopefully all information, or at least the information that most characterizes the respondent, for accurate imputations. In another scenario, our goal is to provide a personalized prediction. Since it is possible to give reasonable predictions with only a subset of questions, we are not concerned with motivating users to answer all questions. Instead, we want to order questions to get information that reduces prediction uncertainty, while not being too burdensome. We illustrate this framework with an example of providing energy estimates to prospective tenants. We also discuss DQO for national surveys and consider connections between our statistics-based question-ordering approach and cognitive survey methodology.},

The activities to date have covered both fundamental and applied statistical research and have focused at least in part on the training of current and future generations of researchers in skills of relevance to surveys and alternative measurement of economic units, households, and persons. This paper discusses some of the key research findings of the eight nodes, organized into six topics: (1) Improving census and survey data collection methods; (2) Using alternative sources of data; (3) Protecting privacy and confidentiality by improving disclosure avoidance; (4) Using spatial and spatio-temporal statistical modeling to improve estimates; (5) Assessing data cost and quality tradeoffs; and (6) Combining information from multiple sources. It also reports on collaborations across nodes and with federal agencies, new software developed, and educational activities and outcomes. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the ability of the FSS to apply the NCRN{\textquoteright}s research outcomes and suggests some next steps, as well as the implications of this research-network model for future federal government renewal initiatives. This paper began as a May 8, 2015 presentation to the National Academies of Science{\textquoteright}s Committee on National Statistics by two of the principal investigators of the National Science Foundation-Census Bureau Research Network (NCRN) - John Abowd and the late Steve Fienberg (Carnegie Mellon University). The authors acknowledge the contributions of the other principal investigators of the NCRN who are not co-authors of the paper (William Block, William Eddy, Alan Karr, Charles Manski, Nicholas Nagle, and Rebecca Nugent), the co- principal investigators, and the comments of Patrick Cantwell, Constance Citro, Adam Eck, Brian Harris-Kojetin, and Eloise Parker. We note with sorrow the deaths of Stephen Fienberg and Allan McCutcheon, two of the original NCRN principal investigators. The principal investigators also wish to acknowledge Cheryl Eavey{\textquoteright}s sterling grant administration on behalf of the NSF.

	abstract = {Multiple imputation is a common approach for dealing with missing values in statistical databases. The imputer fills in missing values with draws from predictive models estimated from the observed data, resulting in multiple, completed versions of the database. Researchers have developed a variety of default routines to implement multiple imputation; however, there has been limited research comparing the performance of these methods, particularly for categorical data. We use simulation studies to compare repeated sampling properties of three default multiple imputation methods for categorical data, including chained equations using generalized linear models, chained equations using classification and regression trees, and a fully Bayesian joint distribution based on Dirichlet Process mixture models. We base the simulations on categorical data from the American Community Survey. In the circumstances of this study, the results suggest that default chained equations approaches based on generalized linear models are dominated by the default regression tree and Bayesian mixture model approaches. They also suggest competing advantages for the regression tree and Bayesian mixture model approaches, making both reasonable default engines for multiple imputation of categorical data.

	pages = {84-108},
	abstract = {It is well established that interviewers learn behaviors both during training and on the job. How this learning occurs has received surprisingly little empirical attention: Is it driven by the interviewer herself or by the respondents she interviews? There are two competing hypotheses about what happens during field data collection: (1) interviewers learn behaviors from their previous interviews, and thus change their behavior in reaction to the behaviors previously encountered; and (2) interviewers encounter different types of and, especially, less cooperative respondents (i.e., nonresponse propensity affecting the measurement error situation), leading to changes in interview behaviors over the course of the field period. We refer to these hypotheses as the experience and response propensity hypotheses, respectively. This paper examines the relationship between proxy indicators for the experience and response propensity hypotheses on interview length using data and paradata from two telephone surveys.Our results indicate that both interviewer-driven experience and respondent-driven response propensity are associated with the length of interview. While general interviewing experience is nonsignificant, within-study experience decreases interview length significantly, even when accounting for changes in sample composition. Interviewers with higher cooperation rates have significantly shorter interviews in study one; however, this effect is mediated by the number of words spoken by the interviewer. We find that older respondents and male respondents have longer interviews despite controlling for the number of words spoken, as do respondents who complete the survey at first contact. Not surprisingly, interviews are significantly longer the more words interviewers and respondents speak.},

The model fuses Dirichlet process mixtures of multinomial distributions for categorical variables with Dirichlet process mixtures of multivariate normal distributions for continuous variables. We incorporate dependence between the continuous and categorical variables by (i) modeling the means of the normal distributions as component-specific functions of the categorical variables and (ii) forming distinct mixture components for the categorical and continuous data with probabilities that are linked via a hierarchical model. This structure allows the model to capture complex dependencies between the categorical and continuous data with minimal tuning by the analyst. We apply the model to impute missing values due to item nonresponse in an evaluation of the redesign of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The goal is to compare estimates from a field test with the new design to estimates from selected individuals from a panel collected under the old design. We show that accounting for the missing data changes some conclusions about the comparability of the distributions in the two datasets. We also perform an extensive repeated sampling simulation using similar data from complete cases in an existing SIPP panel, comparing our proposed model to a default application of multiple imputation by chained equations. Imputations based on the proposed model tend to have better repeated sampling properties than the default application of chained equations in this realistic setting.},

	abstract = {Interest in online rating data has increased in recent years. Such data consists of ordinal ratings of products or local businesses provided by users of a website, such as \Yelp\ or \texttt{Amazon}. One source of heterogeneity in ratings is that users apply different standards when supplying their ratings; even if two users benefit from a product the same amount, they may translate their benefit into ratings in different ways. In this article we propose an ordinal data model, which we refer to as a multi-rubric model, which treats the criteria used to convert a latent utility into a rating as user-specific random effects, with the distribution of these random effects being modeled nonparametrically. We demonstrate that this approach is capable of accounting for this type of variability in addition to usual sources of heterogeneity due to item quality, user biases, interactions between items and users, and the spatial structure of the users and items. We apply the model developed here to publicly available data from the website \Yelp\ and demonstrate that it produces interpretable clusterings of users according to their rating behavior, in addition to providing better predictions of ratings and better summaries of overall item quality.},

Our purpose was to gather experts from various backgrounds together to continue discussing the development of formal privacy systems for Census Bureau data products. is workshop was a successor to a previous workshop held in October 2016 (Vilhuber \&amp; Schmu e 2017). At our prior workshop, we hosted computer scientists, survey statisticians, and economists, all of whom were experts in data privacy. At that time we discussed the practical implementation of cu ing-edge methods for publishing data with formal, provable privacy guarantees, with a focus on applications to Census Bureau data products. e teams developing those applications were just starting out when our rst workshop took place, and we spent our time brainstorming solutions to the various problems researchers were encountering, or anticipated encountering. For these cu ing-edge formal privacy models, there had been very li le e ort in the academic literature to apply those methods in real-world se ings with large, messy data. We therefore brought together an expanded group of specialists from academia and government who could shed light on technical challenges, subject ma er challenges and address how data users might react to changes in data availability and publishing standards. In May 2017, we organized a follow-up workshop, which these proceedings report on. We reviewed progress made in four di erent areas. e four topics discussed as part of the workshop were 1. the 2020 Decennial Census; 2. the American Community Survey (ACS); 3. the 2017 Economic Census; 4. measuring the demand for privacy and for data quality.

	abstract = {The modifiable areal unit problem and the ecological fallacy are known problems that occur when modeling multiscale spatial processes. We investigate how these forms of spatial aggregation error can guide a regionalization over a spatial domain of interest. By "regionalization" we mean a specification of geographies that define the spatial support for areal data. This topic has been studied vigorously by geographers, but has been given less attention by spatial statisticians. Thus, we propose a criterion for spatial aggregation error (CAGE), which we minimize to obtain an optimal regionalization. To define CAGE we draw a connection between spatial aggregation error and a new multiscale representation of the Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion. This relationship between CAGE and the multiscale K-L expansion leads to illuminating theoretical developments including: connections between spatial aggregation error, squared prediction error, spatial variance, and a novel extension of Obled-Creutin eigenfunctions. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through an analysis of two datasets, one using the American Community Survey and one related to environmental ocean winds.},

To formalize this allocation problem, we use tools from statistics and computer science to model the publication technology used by a public statistical agency. We derive the demand for accurate statistics from first principles to generate interdependent preferences that account for the public-good nature of both data accuracy and privacy loss. We first show data accuracy is inefficiently under-supplied by a private provider. Solving the appropriate social planner{\textquoteright}s problem produces an implementable publication strategy. We implement the socially optimal publication plan for statistics on income and health status using data from the American Community Survey, National Health Interview Survey, Federal Statistical System Public Opinion Survey and Cornell National Social Survey. Our analysis indicates that welfare losses from providing too much privacy protection and, therefore, too little accuracy can be substantial.},

We consider the problem of the public release of statistical information about a population-explicitly accounting for the public-good properties of both data accuracy and privacy loss. We first consider the implications of adding the public-good component to recently published models of private data publication under differential privacy guarantees using a Vickery-Clark-Groves mechanism and a Lindahl mechanism. We show that data quality will be inefficiently under-supplied. Next, we develop a standard social planner{\textquoteright}s problem using the technology set implied by (ε, δ)-differential privacy with (α, β)-accuracy for the Private Multiplicative Weights query release mechanism to study the properties of optimal provision of data accuracy and privacy loss when both are public goods. Using the production possibilities frontier implied by this technology, explicitly parameterized interdependent preferences, and the social welfare function, we display properties of the solution to the social planner{\textquoteright}s problem. Our results directly quantify the optimal choice of data accuracy and privacy loss as functions of the technology and preference parameters. Some of these properties can be quantified using population statistics on marginal preferences and correlations between income, data accuracy preferences, and privacy loss preferences that are available from survey data. Our results show that government data custodians should publish more accurate statistics with weaker privacy guarantees than would occur with purely private data publishing. Our statistical results using the General Social Survey and the Cornell National Social Survey indicate that the welfare losses from under-providing data accuracy while over-providing privacy protection can be substantial.

TSE and SDL will move forward together, but integrating multiple criteria: cost, risk, data quality, and decision quality. The chapter explores the value of unifying two key TSE procedures - editing and imputation - with SDL. It discusses {\textquotedblleft}Big data{\textquotedblright} issues, which contains a mathematical formulation that, at least conceptually and at some point in the future, does unify TSE and SDL. Modern approaches to SDL are based explicitly or implicitly on tradeoffs between disclosure risk and data utility. There are three principal classes of SDL methods: reduction/coarsening techniques; perturbative methods; and synthetic data methods. Data swapping is among the most frequently applied SDL methods for categorical data. The chapter sketches how it can be informed by knowledge of TSE.},

The U.S. Census Bureau releases two, national data products that give the magnitude and characteristics of home to work flows. The American Community Survey (ACS) tabulates households{\textquoteright} responses on employment, workplace, and commuting behavior. The Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program tabulates administrative records on jobs in the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES). Design differences across the datasets lead to divergence in a comparable statistic: county-to-county aggregate commute flows. To understand differences in the public use data, this study compares ACS and LEHD source files, using identifying information and probabilistic matching to join person and job records. In our assessment, we compare commuting statistics for job frames linked on person, employment status, employer, and workplace and we identify person and job characteristics as well as design features of the data frames that explain aggregate differences. We find a lower rate of within-county commuting and farther commutes in LODES. We attribute these greater distances to differences in workplace reporting and to uncertainty of establishment assignments in LEHD for workers at multi-unit employers. Minor contributing factors include differences in residence location and ACS workplace edits. The results of this analysis and the data infrastructure developed will support further work to understand and enhance commuting statistics in both datasets.},

	year = {2017},
	abstract = {Entity resolution identifies and removes duplicate entities in large, noisy databases and has grown in both usage and new developments as a result of increased data availability. Nevertheless, entity resolution has tradeoffs regarding assumptions of the data generation process, error rates, and computational scalability that make it a difficult task for real applications. In this paper, we focus on a related problem of unique entity estimation, which is the task of estimating the unique number of entities and associated standard errors in a data set with duplicate entities. Unique entity estimation shares many fundamental challenges of entity resolution, namely, that the computational cost of all-to-all entity comparisons is intractable for large databases. To circumvent this computational barrier, we propose an efficient (near-linear time) estimation algorithm based on locality sensitive hashing. Our estimator, under realistic assumptions, is unbiased and has provably low variance compared to existing random sampling based approaches. In addition, we empirically show its superiority over the state-of-the-art estimators on three real applications. The motivation for our work is to derive an accurate estimate of the documented, identifiable deaths in the ongoing Syrian conflict. Our methodology, when applied to the Syrian data set, provides an estimate of $191,874 \pm 1772$ documented, identifiable deaths, which is very close to the Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) estimate of 191,369. Our work provides an example of challenges and efforts involved in solving a real, noisy challenging problem where modeling assumptions may not hold. },

We demonstrate and investigate this potential risk using two simple but informative scenarios: a single continuous variable possibly with outliers, and a three-way contingency table possibly with small counts in some cells. Beginning with the case that the intruder knows all but one value in the confidential data, we examine the effect on risk of decreasing the number of observations the intruder knows beforehand. We generally find that releasing synthetic data (1) can pose little risk to records in the middle of the distribution, and (2) can pose some risks to extreme outliers, although arguably these risks are mild. We also find that the effect of removing observations from an intruder{\textquoteright}s background knowledge heavily depends on how well that intruder can fill in those missing observations: the risk remains fairly constant if he/she can fill them in well, and drops quickly if he/she cannot. },

Our key innovation involves the representation of the pattern of links between records as a bipartite graph, in which records are directly linked to latent true individuals, and only indirectly linked to other records. This flexible representation of the linkage structure naturally allows us to estimate the attributes of the unique observable people in the population, calculate transitive linkage probabilities across records (and represent this visually), and propagate the uncertainty of record linkage into later analyses. Our method makes it particularly easy to integrate record linkage with post-processing procedures such as logistic regression, capture-recapture, etc. Our linkage structure lends itself to an efficient, linear-time, hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which overcomes many obstacles encountered by previously record linkage approaches, despite the high-dimensional parameter space. We illustrate our method using longitudinal data from the National Long Term Care Survey and with data from the Italian Survey on Household and Wealth, where we assess the accuracy of our method and show it to be better in terms of error rates and empirical scalability than other approaches in the literature.

	abstract = {We introduce a Bayesian approach for analyzing (possibly) high-dimensional dependent data that are distributed according to a member from the natural exponential family of distributions. This problem requires extensive methodological advancements, as jointly modeling high-dimensional dependent data leads to the so-called "big n problem." The computational complexity of the "big n problem" is further exacerbated when allowing for non-Gaussian data models, as is the case here. Thus, we develop new computationally efficient distribution theory for this setting. In particular, we introduce something we call the "conjugate multivariate distribution," which is motivated by the univariate distribution introduced in Diaconis and Ylvisaker (1979). Furthermore, we provide substantial theoretical and methodological development including: results regarding conditional distributions, an asymptotic relationship with the multivariate normal distribution, conjugate prior distributions, and full-conditional distributions for a Gibbs sampler. The results in this manuscript are extremely general, and can be adapted to many different settings. We demonstrate the proposed methodology through simulated examples and analyses based on estimates obtained from the US Census Bureaus{\textquoteright} American Community Survey (ACS).},

	abstract = {Modeling nonstationary processes is of paramount importance to many scientific disciplines including environmental science, ecology, and finance, among others. Consequently, flexible methodology that provides accurate estimation across a wide range of processes is a subject of ongoing interest. We propose a novel approach to model-based time-frequency estimation using time-varying autoregressive models. In this context, we take a fully Bayesian approach and allow both the autoregressive coefficients and innovation variance to vary over time. Importantly, our estimation method uses the lattice filter and is cast within the partial autocorrelation domain. The marginal posterior distributions are of standard form and, as a convenient by-product of our estimation method, our approach avoids undesirable matrix inversions. As such, estimation is extremely computationally efficient and stable. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a comprehensive simulation study that compares our method with other competing methods and find that, in most cases, our approach performs superior in terms of average squared error between the estimated and true time-varying spectral density. Lastly, we demonstrate our methodology through three modeling applications; namely, insect communication signals, environmental data (wind components), and macroeconomic data (US gross domestic product (GDP) and consumption).},

	abstract = {In categorical data, it is typically the case that some combinations of variables are theoretically impossible, such as a three year old child who is married or a man who is pregnant. In practice, however, reported values often include such structural zeros due to, for example, respondent mistakes or data processing errors. To purge data of such errors, many statistical organizations use a process known as edit-imputation. The basic idea is first to select reported values to change according to some heuristic or loss function, and second to replace those values with plausible imputations. This two-stage process typically does not fully utilize information in the data when determining locations of errors, nor does it appropriately reflect uncertainty resulting from the edits and imputations. We present an alternative approach to editing and imputation for categorical microdata with structural zeros that addresses these shortcomings. Specifically, we use a Bayesian hierarchical model that couples a stochastic model for the measurement error process with a Dirichlet process mixture of multinomial distributions for the underlying, error free values. The latter model is restricted to have support only on the set of theoretically possible combinations. We illustrate this integrated approach to editing and imputation using simulation studies with data from the 2000 U. S. census, and compare it to a two-stage edit-imputation routine.

Our proposed methodology is motivated by the American Community Survey (ACS), an ongoing survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau that provides timely information on several key demographic variables. Specifically, the ACS produces 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year "period-estimates," and corresponding margins of errors, for published demographic and socio-economic variables recorded over predefined geographies within the United States. Despite the availability of these predefined geographies it is often of interest to data users to specify customized user-defined spatial supports. In particular, it is useful to estimate demographic variables defined on "new" spatial supports in "real-time." This problem is known as spatial change of support (COS), which is typically performed under the assumption that the data follows a Gaussian distribution. However, count-valued survey data is naturally non-Gaussian and, hence, we consider modeling these data using a Poisson distribution. Additionally, survey-data are often accompanied by estimates of error, which we incorporate into our analysis. We interpret Poisson count-valued data in small areas as an aggregation of events from a spatial point process. This approach provides us with the flexibility necessary to allow ACS users to consider a variety of spatial supports in "real-time." We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a simulated example as well as through an analysis using public-use ACS data.},

Most data fusion techniques rely on variants of conditional independence assumptions. When inappropriate, these assumptions can result in unreliable inferences. We propose a data fusion technique that allows analysts to easily incorporate auxiliary information on the dependence structure of variables not observed jointly; we refer to this auxiliary information as glue. With this technique, we fuse two marketing surveys from the book publisher HarperCollins using glue from the online, rapid-response polling company CivicScience. The fused data enable estimation of associations between people{\textquoteright}s preferences for authors and for learning about new books. The analysis also serves as a case study on the potential for using online surveys to aid data fusion.},

The Gegenbauer class is extensive, including ARFIMA, seasonal ARFIMA, and GARMA processes as special cases. Model estimation is challenging for Gegenbauer processes when multiple zeros and poles occur in the spectral density, because the autocovariance function is laborious to compute. The method of splitting-essentially computing autocovariances by convolving long memory and short memory dynamics-is only tractable when a single long memory pole exists. An additive decomposition of the spectrum into a sum of spectra is proposed, where each summand has a single singularity, so that a computationally efficient splitting method can be applied to each term and then aggregated. This approach differs from handling all the poles in the spectral density at once, via an analysis of truncation error. The proposed technique allows for fast estimation of time series with multiple long-range dependences, which is illustrated numerically and through several case-studies.},

A trusted data curator can increase the utility of data, while managing the risk to establishments, either by releasing synthetic data, or by infusing noise into published statistics. This paper evaluates the application of a differentially private mechanism to publish statistics on wages and job mobility computed from Brazilian employer-employee matched data. The publication mechanism can result in both the publication of specific statistics as well as the generation of synthetic data. I find that the tradeoff between the privacy guaranteed to individuals in the data, and the accuracy of published statistics, is potentially much better that the worst-case theoretical accuracy guarantee. However, the synthetic data fare quite poorly in analyses that are outside the set of queries to which it was trained. Note that this article only explores and characterizes the feasibility of these publication strategies, and will not directly result in the publication of any data. },

interviewers with higher cooperation rates continue to use rapport behaviors
from the cooperation request throughout an interview, 3) interviewers with
higher cooperation rates display more confidence which translates into different
interview behavior, and 4) interviewers with higher cooperation rates continue
their flexible interviewing style throughout the interview and deviate more from
standardized interviewing. We use behavior codes from the Work and Leisure

An alternative to releasing aggregated and/or perturbed data is to release multiply-imputed synthetic data, where sensitive values are replaced with draws from statistical models designed to capture important distributional features in the collected data. One issue that has received relatively little attention, however, is how to handle spatially outlying observations in the collected data, as common spatial models often have a tendency to overfit these observations. The goal of this work is to bring this issue to the forefront and propose a solution, which we refer to as "differential smoothing."

The relationship between hours worked and hours paid, and the conditions under which employers can demand more hours {\textquotedblleft}off the clock,{\textquotedblright} is not well understood. The answer to this question impacts worker welfare, as well as wage and hour regulation. In addition, work off the clock has important implications for the measurement and cyclical movement of productivity and wages. In this paper, I construct a unique administrative dataset of hours paid by employers linked to a survey of workers on their reported hours worked to measure work off the clock. Using cross-sectional variation in local labor markets, I find only a small cyclical component to work off the clock. The results point to labor hoarding rather than efficiency wage theory, indicating work off the clock cannot explain the counter-cyclical movement of productivity. I find workers employed by small firms, and in industries with a high rate of wage and hour violations are associated with larger differences in hours worked than hours paid. These findings suggest the importance of tracking hours of work for enforcement of labor regulations.},

We evaluate the bias from endogenous job mobility in fixed-effects estimates of worker- and firm-specific earnings heterogeneity using longitudinally linked employer-employee data from the LEHD infrastructure file system of the U.S. Census Bureau. First, we propose two new residual diagnostic tests of the assumption that mobility is exogenous to unmodeled determinants of earnings. Both tests reject exogenous mobility. We relax the exogenous mobility assumptions by modeling the evolution of the matched data as an evolving bipartite graph using a Bayesian latent class framework. Our results suggest that endogenous mobility biases estimated firm effects toward zero. To assess validity, we match our estimates of the wage components to out-of-sample estimates of revenue per worker. The corrected estimates attribute much more of the variation in revenue per worker to variation in match quality and worker quality than the uncorrected estimates.

	abstract = {We present a nonparametric Bayesian joint model for multivariate continuous and categorical variables, with the intention of developing a flexible engine for multiple imputation of missing values. The model fuses Dirichlet process mixtures of multinomial distributions for categorical variables with Dirichlet process mixtures of multivariate normal distributions for continuous variables. We incorporate dependence between the continuous and categorical variables by (i) modeling the means of the normal distributions as component-specific functions of the categorical variables and (ii) forming distinct mixture components for the categorical and continuous data with probabilities that are linked via a hierarchical model. This structure allows the model to capture complex dependencies between the categorical and continuous data with minimal tuning by the analyst. We apply the model to impute missing values due to item nonresponse in an evaluation of the redesign of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The goal is to compare estimates from a field test with the new design to estimates from selected individuals from a panel collected under the old design. We show that accounting for the missing data changes some conclusions about the comparability of the distributions in the two datasets. We also perform an extensive repeated sampling simulation using similar data from complete cases in an existing SIPP panel, comparing our proposed model to a default application of multiple imputation by chained equations. Imputations based on the proposed model tend to have better repeated sampling properties than the default application of chained equations in this realistic setting.},

	pages = {224 - 233},
	abstract = {There are often multiple surveys available that estimate and report related demographic variables of interest that are referenced over space and/or time. Not all surveys produce the same information, and thus, combining these surveys typically leads to higher quality estimates. That is, not every survey has the same level of precision nor do they always provide estimates of the same variables. In addition, various surveys often produce estimates with incomplete spatio-temporal coverage. By combining surveys using a Bayesian approach, we can account for different margins of error and leverage dependencies to produce estimates of every variable considered at every spatial location and every time point. Specifically, our strategy is to use a hierarchical modelling approach, where the first stage of the model incorporates the margin of error associated with each survey. Then, in a lower stage of the hierarchical model, the multivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model is used to incorporate multivariate spatio-temporal dependencies of the processes of interest. We adopt a fully Bayesian approach for combining surveys; that is, given all of the available surveys, the conditional distributions of the latent processes of interest are used for statistical inference. To demonstrate our proposed methodology, we jointly analyze period estimates from the US Census Bureau{\textquoteright}s American Community Survey, and estimates obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics program.

Matching job records provides an opportunity to join variables that occur uniquely in separate datasets, to validate responses, and to develop missing data imputation models. Identifying the respondent{\textquoteright}s workplace ({\textquotedblleft}establishment{\textquotedblright}) is valuable for HRS because it allows researchers to incorporate the effects of particular social, economic, and geospatial work environments in studies of respondent health and retirement behavior. The linkage makes use of name and address standardizing techniques tailored to business data that were recently developed in a collaboration between researchers at Census, Cornell, and the University of Michigan. The matching protocol makes no use of the identity of the HRS respondent and strictly protects the confidentiality of information about the respondent{\textquoteright}s employer. The paper first describes the clerical review process used to create a set of human-reviewed candidate pairs, and use of that set to train matching models. It then describes and compares several linking strategies that make use of employer name, address, and phone number. Finally it discusses alternative ways of incorporating information on match uncertainty into estimates based on the linked data, and illustrates their use with a preliminary sample of matched HRS jobs.

Many methodological issues have arose in this endeavor, including the concern about the quality of the time use data. Survey researchers have increasingly turned to the analysis of paradata to better understand and model data quality. In particular, it has been argued that paradata may serve as proxy of the respondents{\textquoteright} cognitive response process, and can be used as an additional tool to assess the impact of data generation on data quality. In this presentation, data quality in the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) will be assessed through the use of paradata and survey responses. Specifically, I will talk about a data quality index I have created, which includes measures of different types of ATUS errors (e.g. low number of reported activities, failures to report an activity), and paradata variables (e.g. response latencies, incompletes). The overall objective of this study is to contribute to data quality assessment in the collection of timeline data from national surveys by providing insights on those interviewing dynamics that most impact data quality. These insights will help to improve future instruments and training of interviewers, as well as to reduce costs.

	abstract = {NCRN Meeting Spring 2016: The ATUS and SIPP-EHC: Recent Developments Belli, Robert F. One of the main objectives of the NCRN award to the University of Nebraska node is to investigate data quality associated with timeline interviewing as conducted with the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) time diary and the Survey of Income and Program Participation event history calendar (SIPP-EHC). Specifically, our efforts are focused on the relationships between interviewing dynamics as extracted from analyses of paradata with measures of data quality. With the ATUS, our recent efforts have revealed that respondents differ in how they handle difficulty with remembering activities, with some overcoming these difficulties and others succumbing to them. With the SIPP-EHC, we are still in the initial stages of extracting variables from the paradata that are associated with interviewing dynamics. Our work has also involved the development of a CATI time diary in which we are able to analyze audio streams to capture interviewing dynamics. I will conclude this talk by discussing challenges that have yet to be overcome with our work, and our vision of moving forward with the eventual development of self-administered timeline instruments that will be respondent-friendly due to the assistance of intelligent-agent driven virtual interviewers.

Our method also ensures that the protected statistics will be identical in all releases based on the same inputs.},

This model has been challenged on several fronts, including the absence of parallel linkages across pathways. Calendar survey interviewing shows the frequent and varied use of parallel associations in autobiographical recall. Parallel associations in these data are commonplace, and are driven more by respondents{\textquoteright} generative retrieval than by interviewers{\textquoteright} probing. Parallel associations represent a number of autobiographical knowledge themes that are interrelated across life domains. The content of parallel associations is nearly evenly split between general and transitional events, supporting the importance of transitions in autographical memory. Associations in respondents{\textquoteright} memories (both parallel and sequential), demonstrate complex interactions with interviewer verbal behaviors during generative retrieval. In addition to discussing the implications of these results to the SMS model, implications are also drawn for transition theory and the basic-systems model.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic record linkage, the task of merging two or more databases in the absence of a unique identifier, is a perennial and challenging problem. It is closely related to the problem of deduplicating a single database, which can be cast as linking a single database against itself. In both cases the number of possible links grows rapidly in the size of the databases under consideration, and in most applications it is necessary to first reduce the number of record pairs that will be compared.
Spurred by practical considerations, a range of methods have been developed for this task. These methods go under a variety of names, including indexing and blocking, and have seen significant development. However, methods for inferring linkage structure that account for indexing, blocking, and additional filtering steps have not seen commensurate development. In this paper we review the implications of indexing, blocking and filtering within the popular Fellegi-Sunter framework, and propose a new model to account for particular forms of indexing and filtering.},

	abstract = {Many analyses require linking records from two databases comprising overlapping sets of individuals. In the absence of unique identifiers, the linkage procedure often involves matching on a set of categorical variables, such as demographics, common to both files. Typically, however, the resulting matches are inexact: some cross-classifications of the matching variables do not generate unique links across files. Further, the matching variables can be subject to reporting errors, which introduce additional uncertainty in analyses. We present a Bayesian file matching methodology designed to estimate regression models and match records simultaneously when categorical matching variables are subject to reporting error. The method relies on a hierarchical model that includes (1) the regression of interest involving variables from the two files given a vector indicating the links, (2) a model for the linking vector given the true values of the matching variables, (3) a measurement error model for reported values of the matching variables given their true values, and (4) a model for the true values of the matching variables. We describe algorithms for sampling from the posterior distribution of the model. We illustrate the methodology using artificial data and data from education records in the state of North Carolina.},

	abstract = {Business establishment microdata typically are required to satisfy agency-specified edit rules, such as balance equations and linear inequalities. Inevitably some establishments{\textquoteright} reported data violate the edit rules. Statistical agencies correct faulty values using a process known as edit-imputation. Business establishment data also must be heavily redacted before being shared with the public; indeed, confidentiality concerns lead many agencies not to share establishment microdata as unrestricted access files. When microdata must be heavily redacted, one approach is to create synthetic data, as done in the U.S. Longitudinal Business Database and the German IAB Establishment Panel. This article presents the first implementation of a fully integrated approach to edit-imputation and data synthesis. We illustrate the approach on data from the U.S. Census of Manufactures and present a variety of evaluations of the utility of the synthetic data. The paper also presents assessments of disclosure risks for several intruder attacks. We find that the synthetic data preserve important distributional features from the post-editing confidential microdata, and have low risks for the various attacks.},

	abstract = {My dissertation studies decision questions for government statistical agencies, both regarding data collection and how to combine data from multiple sources. Informed decisions regarding expenditure on data collection require information about the effects of data quality on data use. For the first topic, I study two important uses of decennial census data in the U.S.: for apportioning the House of Representatives and for allocating federal funds. Estimates of distortions in these two uses are developed for different levels of census accuracy. Then, I thoroughly investigate the sensitivity of findings to the census error distribution and to the choice of how to measure the distortions. The chapter concludes with a proposed framework for partial cost-benefit analysis that charges a share of the cost of the census to allocation programs.

Then, I investigate an approximation to make analysis of the effects of census error on allocations feasible when allocations also depend on non-census statistics, as is the case for many formula-based allocations. The approximation conditions on the realized values of the non-census statistics instead of using the joint distribution over both census and non-census statistics. The research studies how using the approximation affects conclusions. I find that in some simple cases, the approximation always either overstates or equals the true effects of census error. Understatement is possible in other cases, but theory suggests that the largest possible understatements are about one-third the amount of the largest possible overstatements. In simulations with a more complex allocation formula, the approximation tends to overstate the effects of census error with the overstatement increasing with error in non-census statistics but decreasing with error in census statistics.

In the final chapter, I evaluate the use of 2008-2010 property tax data from CoreLogic, Inc. (CoreLogic), aggregated from county and township governments from around the country, to improve 2010 American Community Survey (ACS) estimates of property tax amounts for single-family homes.

Particularly, I evaluate the potential to use CoreLogic to reduce respondent burden, to study survey response error and to improve adjustments for survey nonresponse. The coverage of the CoreLogic data varies between counties as does the correspondence between ACS and CoreLogic property taxes. This geographic variation implies that different approaches toward using CoreLogic are needed in different areas of the country. Further, large differences between CoreLogic and ACS property taxes in certain counties seem to be due to conceptual differences between what is collected in the two data sources. I examine three counties, Clark County, NV, Philadelphia County, PA and St. Louis County, MO, and compare how estimates would change with different approaches using the CoreLogic data. Mean county property tax estimates are highly sensitive to whether ACS or CoreLogic data are used to construct estimates. Using CoreLogic data in imputation modeling for nonresponse adjustment of ACS estimates modestly improves the predictive power of imputation models, although estimates of county property taxes and property taxes by mortgage status are not very sensitive to the imputation method.},

Behavioral sequences of interviewer-respondent interactions that were most predictive of respondents spontaneously using parallel, timing, duration, and sequential retrieval strategies in their generation of answers were examined. We also examined which behavioral sequences were predictive of retrospective reporting data quality as shown by correspondence between calendar responses with responses collected in prior waves of the PSID. The verbal behaviors of immediately preceding interviewer and respondent turns of speech were assessed in terms of their co-occurrence with each respondent retrieval strategy. Interviewers{\textquoteright} use of parallel probes is associated with poorer data quality, whereas interviewers{\textquoteright} use of timing and duration probes, especially in tandem, is associated with better data quality. Respondents{\textquoteright} use of timing and duration strategies is also associated with better data quality and both strategies are facilitated by interviewer timing probes. Data mining alongside regression techniques is valuable to examine which interviewer-respondent interactions will benefit data quality.

Panel surveys typically su↵er from attrition, which can lead to biased inference when basing analysis only on cases that complete all waves of the panel. Unfortunately, panel data alone cannot inform the extent of the bias from the attrition, so that analysts using the panel data alone must make strong and untestable assumptions about the missing data mechanism. Many panel studies also include refreshment samples, which are data collected from a random sample of new individuals during some later wave of the panel. Refreshment samples o↵er information that can be utilized to correct for biases induced by nonignorable attrition while reducing reliance on strong assumptions about the attrition process. To date, these bias correction methods have not dealt with two key practical issues in panel studies: unit nonresponse in the initial wave of the panel and in the refreshment sample itself. As we illustrate, nonignorable unit nonresponse can significantly compromise the analyst{\textquoteright}s ability to use the refreshment samples for attrition bias correction. Thus, it is crucial for analysts to assess how sensitive their inferences{\textemdash}corrected for panel attrition{\textemdash}are to di↵erent assumptions about the nature of the unit nonresponse. We present an approach that facilitates such sensitivity analyses, both for suspected nonignorable unit nonresponse in the initial wave and in the refreshment sample. We illustrate the approach using simulation studies and an analysis of data from the 2007-2008 Associated Press/Yahoo News election panel study.

With appropriate modeling, these samples can be leveraged to correct inferences for biases caused by non-ignorable attrition. We present such a model when the panel includes many categorical survey variables. The model relies on a Bayesian latent pattern mixture model, in which an indicator for attrition and the survey variables are modeled jointly via a latent class model. We allow the multinomial probabilities within classes to depend on the attrition indicator, which offers additional flexibility over standard applications of latent class models. We present results of simulation studies that illustrate the benefits of this flexibility. We apply the model to correct attrition bias in an analysis of data from the 2007-2008 Associated Press/Yahoo News election panel study. },

When sharing these data with others, data stewards strive to disseminate data that are informative for a wide range of spatial and non-spatial analyses while simultaneously protecting the confidentiality of data subjects{\textquoteright} identities and attributes. Typically, data stewards meet this challenge by coarsening the resolution of the released geography and, as needed, perturbing the confidential attributes. When done with high intensity, these redaction strategies can result in released data with poor analytic quality. We propose an alternative dissemination approach based on fully synthetic data. We generate data using marked point process models that can maintain both the statistical properties and the spatial dependence structure of the confidential data. We illustrate the approach using data consisting of mortality records from Durham, North Carolina.},

Most data fusion techniques rely on variants of conditional independence assumptions. When inappropriate, these assumptions can result in unreliable inferences. We propose a data fusion technique that allows analysts to easily incorporate auxiliary information on the dependence structure of variables not observed jointly; we refer to this auxiliary information as glue. With this technique, we fuse two marketing surveys from the book publisher HarperCollins using glue from the online, rapid-response polling company CivicScience. The fused data enable estimation of associations between people{\textquoteright}s preferences for authors and for learning about new books. The analysis also serves as a case study on the potential for using online surveys to aid data fusion.},

Users of the statistics may incorrectly view them as error free or may incorrectly conjecture error magnitudes. This paper discusses strategies to mitigate misinterpretation of official statistics by communicating uncertainty to the public. Sampling error can be measured using established statistical principles. The challenge is to satisfactorily measure the various forms of nonsampling error. I find it useful to distinguish transitory statistical uncertainty, permanent statistical uncertainty, and conceptual uncertainty. I illustrate how each arises as the Bureau of Economic Analysis periodically revises GDP estimates, the Census Bureau generates household income statistics from surveys with nonresponse, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics seasonally adjusts employment statistics. I anchor my discussion of communication of uncertainty in the contribution of Oskar Morgenstern (1963a), who argued forcefully for agency publication of error estimates for official economic statistics.

The authors describe uses, and limitations, of cost-benefit analysis for this decision problem in the case of the 2016 census of South Africa. The government of South Africa needed to decide whether to conduct a 2016 census or to rely on increasingly inaccurate post-censal estimates accounting for births, deaths, and migration since the previous (2011) census. The cost-benefit analysis compared predicted costs of the 2016 census to the benefits from improved allocation of intergovernmental revenue, which was considered by the government to be a critical use of the 2016 census, although not the only important benefit. Without the 2016 census, allocations would be based on population estimates. Accuracy of the post-censal estimates was estimated from the performance of past estimates, and the hypothetical expected reduction in errors in allocation due to the 2016 census was estimated. A loss function was introduced to quantify the improvement in allocation. With this evidence, the government was able to decide not to conduct the 2016 census, but instead to improve data and capacity for producing post-censal estimates.</p>

Such data arise frequently in social science settings, for example, people living in households. The model assumes that (i) each group is a member of a group-level latent class, and (ii) each unit is a member of a unit-level latent class nested within its group-level latent class. This structure allows the model to capture dependence among units in the same group. It also facilitates simultaneous modeling of variables at both group and unit levels. We develop a version of the model that assigns zero probability to groups and units with physically impossible combinations of variables. We apply the model to estimate multivariate relationships in a subset of the American Community Survey. Using the estimated model, we generate synthetic household data that could be disseminated as redacted public use files with high analytic validity and low disclosure risks.

It is desirable to have information about the consequences of the accuracy that might be attainable for that cost or for alternative cost levels. To assess the consequences of imperfect census accuracy, Seeskin and Spencer consider alternative profiles of accuracy for states and assess their implications for apportionment of the U.S. House of Representatives and for allocation of federal funds. An error in allocation is defined as the difference between the allocation computed under imperfect data and the allocation computed with perfect data. Estimates of expected sums of absolute values of errors are presented for House apportionment and for federal funds allocations.</p>

The imputer fills in missing values with draws from predictive models estimated from the observed data, resulting in multiple, completed versions of the database. Researchers have developed a variety of default routines to implement multiple imputation; however, there has been limited research comparing the performance of these methods, particularly for categorical data. We use simulation studies to compare repeated sampling properties of three default multiple imputation methods for categorical data, including chained equations using generalized linear models, chained equations using classification and regression trees, and a fully Bayesian joint distribution based on Dirichlet Process mixture models. We base the simulations on categorical data from the American Community Survey. The results suggest that default chained equations approaches based on generalized linear models are dominated by the default regression tree and mixture model approaches. They also suggest competing advantages for the regression tree and mixture model approaches, making both reasonable default engines for multiple imputation of categorical data.},

	address = {Ann Arbor, MI},
	abstract = {The increased exposure of the United States to economic shocks originating from abroad is a common concern of those critical of globalization. An understanding of the cross-country transmission of shocks is of central importance for policymakers seeking to limit excess volatility resulting from international linkages. Firms whose ownership spans multiple countries are one under-appreciated mechanism. These multinationals represent an enormous share of the global economy, but a general scarcity of firm-level data has limited our understanding of how they affect both origin and destination countries. One contribution of this dissertation is to expand the data availability on these firms, using innovative data-linking techniques. The first chapter provides some of the first ever causal evidence on the role of trade and multinational production in the transmission of economic shocks and the cross-country synchronization of business cycles. This chapter leverages the 2011 Japanese earthquake/tsunami as a natural experiment. It finds that those U.S. firms with large exposure to intermediate inputs from Japan -- typically the affiliates of Japanese multinationals -- experience significant output declines after this shock, roughly one-for-one with declines in imported inputs. Structural estimation of the production function reveals substantial complementarities between imported and domestic inputs. These results suggest that global supply chains are more rigid than previously thought. The second chapter incorporates this low production elasticity of imported inputs into an otherwise standard dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. The low degree of input substitutability, when applied to the share of trade governed by multinational firms, can generate effects in the aggregate. Value-added co-movement increases by 11 percentage points in the baseline model relative to a model where such features are absent. The model confirms that real linkages -- in addition to financial and policy spillovers -- play an important role in business cycle synchronization. The third chapter describes additional characteristics of multinational firms relative to domestic and exporting firms in the U.S. economy. These firms are larger, more productive, more capital intensive, and pay higher wages than other firms. The relative patterns of trade and output offer valuable guidance for the motives for ownership that spans national boundaries.},

	title = {Four Essays in Unemployment, Wage Dynamics and Subjective Expectations},
	year = {2015},
	school = {University of Michigan},
	type = {Ph.D.},
	address = {Ann Arbor, MI},
	abstract = {This dissertation contains four essays on unemployment differences between skill groups, on the effect of non-employment on wages and measurement error, and on subjective expectations of Americans about mortality and the stock market. Chapter 1 tests how much of the unemployment rate differences between education groups can be explained by occupational differences in labor adjustment costs. The educational gap in unemployment is substantial. Recent empirical studies found that the largest component of labor adjustment costs are adaptation costs: newly hired workers need a few month get up to speed and reach full productivity. The chapter evaluates the effect of adaptation costs on unemployment using a calibrated search and matching model. Chapter 2 tests how short periods of non-employment affect survey reports of annual earnings. Non-employment has strong and non-standard effects on response error in earnings. Persons tend to report the permanent component of their earnings accurately, but transitory shocks are underreported. Transitory shocks due to career interruptions are very large, taking up several month of lost earnings, on average, and people only report 60-85\% percent of these earnings losses. The resulting measurement error is non-standard: it has a positive mean, it is right-skewed, and the bias correlates with predictors of turnover. Chapter 3 proposes and tests a model, the modal response hypothesis, to explain patterns in mortality expectations of Americans. The model is a mathematical expression of the idea that survey responses of 0\%, 50\%, or 100\% to probability questions indicate a high level of uncertainty about the relevant probability. The chapter shows that subjective survival expectations in 2002 line up very well with realized mortality of the HRS respondents between 2002 and 2010 and our model performs better than typically used models in the literature of subjective probabilities. Chapter 4 analyzes the impact of the stock market crash of 2008 on households{\textquoteright} expectations about the returns on the stock market index: the population average of expectations, the average uncertainty, and the cross-sectional heterogeneity in expectations from March 2008 to February 2009.},

	abstract = {We present a nonparametric Bayesian joint model for multivariate continuous and categorical variables, with the intention of developing a flexible engine for multiple imputation of missing values. The model fuses Dirichlet process mixtures of multinomial distributions for categorical variables with Dirichlet process mixtures of multivariate normal distributions for continuous variables. We incorporate dependence between the continuous and categorical variables by (i) modeling the means of the normal distributions as component-specific functions of the categorical variables and (ii) forming distinct mixture components for the categorical and continuous data with probabilities that are linked via a hierarchical model. This structure allows the model to capture complex dependencies between the categorical and continuous data with minimal tuning by the analyst. We apply the model to impute missing values due to item nonresponse in an evaluation of the redesign of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The goal is to compare estimates from a field test with the new design to estimates from selected individuals from a panel collected under the old design. We show that accounting for the missing data changes some conclusions about the comparability of the distributions in the two datasets. We also perform an extensive repeated sampling simulation using similar data from complete cases in an existing SIPP panel, comparing our proposed model to a default application of multiple imputation by chained equations. Imputations based on the proposed model tend to have better repeated sampling properties than the default application of chained equations in this realistic setting.},

Multivariate spatial covariance models need to be built with care, since any covariance matrix that is derived from such a model must be nonnegative-definite. In this article, we develop a conditional approach for spatial-model construction whose validity conditions are easy to check. We start with bivariate spatial covariance models and go on to demonstrate the approach{\textquoteright}s connection to multivariate models defined by networks of spatial variables. In some circumstances, such as modelling respiratory illness conditional on air pollution, the direction of conditional dependence is clear. When it is not, the two directional models can be compared. More generally, the graph structure of the network reduces the number of possible models to compare. Model selection then amounts to finding possible causative links in the network. We demonstrate our conditional approach on surface temperature and pressure data, where the role of the two variables is seen to be asymmetric.},

	year = {2015},
	abstract = {Many data sources report related variables of interest that are also referenced over geographic regions and time; however, there are relatively few general statistical methods that one can readily use that incorporate these multivariate spatio-temporal dependencies. Additionally, many multivariate spatio-temporal areal datasets are extremely high-dimensional, which leads to practical issues when formulating statistical models. For example, we analyze Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) published by the US Census Bureau{\textquoteright}s Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program. QWIs are available by different variables, regions, and time points, resulting in millions of tabulations. Despite their already expansive coverage, by adopting a fully Bayesian framework, the scope of the QWIs can be extended to provide estimates of missing values along with associated measures of uncertainty. Motivated by the LEHD, and other applications in federal statistics, we introduce the multivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model (MSTM), which can be used to efficiently model high-dimensional multivariate spatio-temporal areal datasets. The proposed MSTM extends the notion of Moran{\textquoteright}s I basis functions to the multivariate spatio-temporal setting. This extension leads to several methodological contributions including extremely effective dimension reduction, a dynamic linear model for multivariate spatio-temporal areal processes, and the reduction of a high-dimensional parameter space using {a novel} parameter model.},

	abstract = {Many data sources report related variables of interest that are also referenced over geographic regions
and time; however, there are relatively few general statistical methods that one can readily
use that incorporate these multivariate spatio-temporal dependencies. Additionally, many multivariate
spatio-temporal areal datasets are extremely high-dimensional, which leads to practical
issues when formulating statistical models. For example, we analyze Quarterly Workforce Indicators
(QWI) published by the US Census Bureau{\textquoteright}s Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics
(LEHD) program. QWIs are available by different variables, regions, and time points, resulting
in millions of tabulations. Despite their already expansive coverage, by adopting a fully Bayesian
framework, the scope of the QWIs can be extended to provide estimates of missing values along
with associated measures of uncertainty. Motivated by the LEHD, and other applications in federal
statistics, we introduce the multivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model (MSTM), which can
be used to efficiently model high-dimensional multivariate spatio-temporal areal datasets. The proposed
MSTM extends the notion of Moran{\textquoteright}s I basis functions to the multivariate spatio-temporal
setting. This extension leads to several methodological contributions including extremely effective
dimension reduction, a dynamic linear model for multivariate spatio-temporal areal processes, and
the reduction of a high-dimensional parameter space using a novel parameter model.},

We use the bipartite graph representation of longitudinally linked employer-employee data, and the associated projections onto the employer and employee nodes, respectively, to characterize the set of potential statistical summaries that the trusted custodian might produce. We consider noise infusion as the primary confidentiality protection method. We show that a relatively straightforward extension of the dynamic noise-infusion method used in the U.S. Census Bureau{\textquoteright}s Quarterly Workforce Indicators can be adapted to provide the same confidentiality guarantees for the graph-based statistics: all inputs have been modified by a minimum percentage deviation (i.e., no actual respondent data are used) and, as the number of entities contributing to a particular statistic increases, the accuracy of that statistic approaches the unprotected value. Our method also ensures that the protected statistics will be identical in all releases based on the same inputs.},

	abstract = {Dirichlet process mixtures can be useful models of multivariate categorical data and effective tools for multiple imputation of missing categorical values. In some contexts, however, these models can fit certain variables well at the expense of others in ways beyond the analyst{\textquoteright}s control. For example, when the data include some variables with non-trivial amounts of missing values, the mixture model may fit the marginal distributions of the nearly and fully complete variables at the expense of the variables with high fractions of missing data. Motivated by this setting, we present a Dirichlet process mixture model for mixed ordinal and nominal data that allows analysts to split variables into two groups: focus variables and remainder variables. The model uses three sets of clusters, one set for ordinal focus variables, one for nominal focus variables, and one for all remainder variables. The model uses a multivariate ordered probit specification for the ordinal variables and independent multinomial kernels for the nominal variables. The three sets of clusters are linked using an infinite tensor factorization prior, as well as via dependence of the means of the latent continuous focus variables on the remainder variables. This effectively specifies a rich, complex model for the focus variables and a simpler model for remainder variables, yet still potentially captures associations among the variables. In the multiple imputation context, focus variables include key variables with high rates of missing values, and remainder variables include variables without much missing data. Using simulations, we illustrate advantages and limitations of using focused clustering compared to mixture models that do not distinguish variables.

This sort of unstructured discussion is currently not feasible as a part of the otherwise successful metadata repositories. Creating and augmenting metadata is a labor-intensive endeavor. Harnessing collective knowledge from actual data users can supplement officially generated metadata. As part of our Comprehensive Extensible Data Documentation and Access Repository (CED2AR) infrastructure, we demonstrate a prototype of crowdsourced DDI, using DDI-C and supplemental XML. The system allows for any number of network connected instances (web or desktop deployments) of the CED2AR DDI editor to concurrently create and modify metadata. The backend transparently handles changes, and frontend has the ability to separate official edits (by designated curators of the data and the metadata) from crowd-sourced content. We briefly discuss offline edit contributions as well. CED2AR uses DDI-C and supplemental XML together with Git for a very portable and lightweight implementation. This distributed network implementation allows for large scale metadata curation without the need for a hardware intensive computing environment, and can leverage existing cloud services, such as Github or Bitbucket.

	year = {2015},
	school = {Cornell University},
	type = {Dissertation},
	abstract = {We investigate probabilistic hashing techniques for addressing computational and memory challenges in large scale machine learning and data mining systems. In this thesis, we show that the traditional idea of hashing goes far beyond near-neighbor search and there are some striking new possibilities. We show that hashing can improve state of the art large scale learning algorithms, and it goes beyond the conventional notions of pairwise similarities. Despite being a very well studied topic in literature, we found several opportunities for fundamentally improving some of the well know textbook hashing algorithms. In particular, we show that the traditional way of computing minwise hashes is unnecessarily expensive and without loosing anything we can achieve an order of magnitude speedup. We also found that for cosine similarity search there is a better scheme than SimHash. In the end, we show that the existing locality sensitive hashing framework itself is very restrictive, and we cannot have efficient algorithms for some important measures like inner products which are ubiquitous in machine learning. We propose asymmetric locality sensitive hashing (ALSH), an extended framework, where we show provable and practical efficient algorithms for Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS). Having such an efficient solutions to MIPS directly scales up many popular machine learning algorithms. We believe that this thesis provides significant improvements to some of the heavily used subroutines in big-data systems, which we hope will be adopted.},

	title = {Ranking Firms Using Revealed Preference and Other Essays About Labor Markets},
	year = {2015},
	school = {University of Michigan},
	type = {Ph.D.},
	address = {Ann Arbor, MI},
	abstract = {This dissertation contains essays on three questions about the labor market. Chapter 1 considers the question: why do some firms pay so much and some so little? Firms account for a substantial portion of earnings inequality. Although the standard explanation is that there are search frictions that support an equilibrium with rents, this chapter finds that compensating differentials for nonpecuniary characteristics are at least as important. To reach this finding, this chapter develops a structural search model and estimates it on U.S. administrative data. The model analyzes the revealed preference information in the labor market: specifically, how workers move between the 1.5 million firms in the data. With on the order of 1.5 million parameters, standard estimation approaches are infeasible and so the chapter develops a new estimation approach that is feasible on such big data. Chapter 2 considers the question: why do men and women work at different firms? Men work for higher-paying firms than women. The chapter builds on chapter 1 to consider two explanations for why men and women work in different firms. First, men and women might search from different offer distributions. Second, men and women might have different rankings of firms. Estimation finds that the main explanation for why men and women are sorted is that women search from a lower-paying offer distribution than men. Indeed, men and women are estimated to have quite similar rankings of firms. Chapter 3 considers the question: what are there long-run effects of the minimum wage? An empirical consensus suggests that there are small employment effects of minimum wage increases. This chapter argues that these are short-run elasticities. Long-run elasticities, which may differ from short-run elasticities, are more policy relevant. This chapter develops a dynamic industry equilibrium model of labor demand. The model makes two points. First, long-run regressions have been misinterpreted because even if the short- and long-run employment elasticities differ, standard methods would not detect a difference using U.S. variation. Second, the model offers a reconciliation of the small estimated short-run employment effects with the commonly found pass-through of minimum wage increases to product prices.},

	abstract = {In this article, we describe Stata utilities that facilitate probabilistic record linkage{\textemdash}the technique typically used for merging two datasets with no common record identifier. While the preprocessing tools are developed specifically for linking two company databases, the other tools can be used for many different types of linkage. Specifically, the stnd\_compname and stnd\_address commands parse and standardize company names and addresses to improve the match quality when linking. The reclink2 command is a generalized version of Blasnik{\textquoteright}s reclink (2010, Statistical Software Components S456876, Department of Economics, Boston College) that allows for many-to-one matching. Finally, clrevmatch is an interactive tool that allows the user to review matched results in an efficient and seamless manner. Rather than exporting results to another file format (for example, Excel), inputting clerical reviews, and importing back into Stata, one can use the clrevmatch tool to conduct all of these steps within Stata. This helps improve the speed and flexibility of matching, which often involves multiple runs.},

	journal = {ArXiv},
	year = {2015},
	abstract = {The modifiable areal unit problem and the ecological fallacy are known problems that occur when modeling multiscale spatial processes. We investigate how these forms of spatial aggregation error can guide a regionalization over a spatial domain of interest. By "regionalization" we mean a specification of geographies that define the spatial support for areal data. This topic has been studied vigorously by geographers, but has been given less attention by spatial statisticians. Thus, we propose a criterion for spatial aggregation error (CAGE), which we minimize to obtain an optimal regionalization. To define CAGE we draw a connection between spatial aggregation error and a new multiscale representation of the Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion. This relationship between CAGE and the multiscale K-L expansion leads to illuminating theoretical developments including: connections between spatial aggregation error, squared prediction error, spatial variance, and a novel extension of Obled-Creutin eigenfunctions. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through an analysis of two datasets, one using the American Community Survey and one related to environmental ocean winds.},

	title = {Relaxations of differential privacy and risk utility evaluations of synthetic data and fidelity measures},
	volume = {PhD},
	year = {2015},
	school = {Duke University },
	abstract = {Many organizations collect data that would be useful to public researchers, but cannot be shared due to promises of confidentiality to those that participated in the study. This thesis evaluates the risks and utility of several existing release methods, as well as develops new ones with different risk/utility tradeoffs.

In Chapter 2, I present a new risk metric, called model-specific probabilistic differ- ential privacy (MPDP), which is a relaxed version of differential privacy that allows the risk of a release to be based on the worst-case among plausible datasets instead of all possible datasets. In addition, I develop a generic algorithm called local sensitiv- ity random sampling (LSRS) that, under certain assumptions, is guaranteed to give releases that meet MPDP for any query with computable local sensitivity. I demon- strate, using several well-known queries, that LSRS releases have much higher utility than standard differentially private release mechanism, the Laplace Mechanism, at only marginally higher risk.

In Chapter 3, using to synthesis models, I empirically characterize the risks of releasing synthetic data under the standard {\textquotedblleft}all but one{\textquotedblright} assumption on intruder background knowledge, as well the effect decreasing the number of observations the intruder knows beforehand has on that risk. I find in these examples that even in the {\textquotedblleft}all but one{\textquotedblright} case, there is no risk except to extreme outliers, and even then the risk is mild. I find that the effect of removing observations from an intruder{\textquoteright}s background knowledge has on risk heavily depends on how well that intruder can fill in those missing observations: the risk remains fairly constant if he/she can fill them in well, and the risk drops quickly if he/she cannot.

In Chapter 4, I characterize the risk/utility tradeoffs for an augmentation of synthetic data called fidelity measures (see Section 1.2.3). Fidelity measures were proposed in Reiter et al. (2009) to quantify the degree to which the results of an analysis performed on a released synthetic dataset match with the results of the same analysis performed on the confidential data. I compare the risk/utility of two different fidelity measures, the confidence interval overlap (Karr et al., 2006) and a new fidelity measure I call the mean predicted probability difference (MPPD). Simultaneously, I compare the risk/utility tradeoffs of two different private release mechanisms, LSRS and a heuristic release method called {\textquotedblleft}safety zones{\textquotedblright}. I find that the confidence interval overlap can be applied to a wider variety of analyses and is more specific than MPPD, but MPPD is more robust to the influence of individual observations in the confidential data, which means it can be released with less noise than the confidence interval overlap with the same level of risk. I also find that while safety zones are much simpler to compute and generally have good utility (whereas the utility of LSRS depends on the value of ε), it is also much more vulnerable to context specific attacks that, while not easy for an intruder to implement, are difficult to anticipate.},

	abstract = {We present hierarchical Bayesian methodology to perform spatio-temporal change of support (COS) for survey data with Gaussian sampling errors. This methodology is motivated by the American Community Survey (ACS), which is an ongoing survey administered by the US Census Bureau that provides timely information on several key demographic variables. The ACS has published 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year period estimates, and margins of errors, for demographic and socio-economic variables recorded over predefined geographies. The spatio-temporal COS methodology considered here provides data users with a way to estimate ACS variables on customized geographies and time periods while accounting for sampling errors. Additionally, 3-year ACS period estimates are to be discontinued, and this methodology can provide predictions of ACS variables for 3-year periods given the available period estimates. The methodology is based on a spatio-temporal mixed-effects model with a low-dimensional spatio-temporal basis function representation, which provides multi-resolution estimates through basis function aggregation in space and time. This methodology includes a novel parameterization that uses a target dynamical process and recently proposed parsimonious Moran{\textquoteright}s I propagator structures. Our approach is demonstrated through two applications using public-use ACS estimates and is shown to produce good predictions on a hold-out set of 3-year period estimates.

	abstract = {In 2010 the American Community Survey (ACS) replaced the long form of the decennial census as the sole national source of demographic and economic data for small geographic areas such as census tracts. These small area estimates suffer from large margins of error, however, which makes the data difficult to use for many purposes. The value of a large and comprehensive survey like the ACS is that it provides a richly detailed, multivariate, composite picture of small areas. This article argues that one solution to the problem of large margins of error in the ACS is to shift from a variable-based mode of inquiry to one that emphasizes a composite multivariate picture of census tracts. Because the margin of error in a single ACS estimate, like household income, is assumed to be a symmetrically distributed random variable, positive and negative errors are equally likely. Because the variable-specific estimates are largely independent from each other, when looking at a large collection of variables these random errors average to zero. This means that although single variables can be methodologically problematic at the census tract scale, a large collection of such variables provides utility as a contextual descriptor of the place(s) under investigation. This idea is demonstrated by developing a geodemographic typology of all U.S. census tracts. The typology is firmly rooted in the social scientific literature and is organized around a framework of concepts, domains, and measures. The typology is validated using public domain data from the City of Chicago and the U.S. Federal Election Commission. The typology, as well as the data and methods used to create it, is open source and published freely online.

The modeling framework enables highly flexible inference for ordinal regression relationships, avoiding assumptions of linearity or additivity in the covariate effects. In standard parametric ordinal regression models, computational challenges arise from identifiability constraints and estimation of parameters requiring nonstandard inferential techniques. A key feature of the nonparametric model is that it achieves inferential flexibility, while avoiding these difficulties. In particular, we establish full support of the nonparametric mixture model under fixed cut-off points that relate through discretization the latent continuous responses with the ordinal responses. The practical utility of the modeling approach is illustrated through application to two data sets from econometrics, an example involving regression relationships for ozone concentration, and a multirater agreement problem.},

	abstract = {<p><span>Vector autoregressive (VAR) models have become a staple in the analysis of multivariate time series and are formulated in the time domain as difference equations, with an implied covariance structure. In many contexts, it is desirable to work with a stable, or at least stationary, representation. To fit such models, one must impose restrictions on the coefficient matrices to ensure that certain determinants are nonzero; which, except in special cases, may prove burdensome. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose a flexible frequency domain model expressed in terms of the spectral density matrix. Specifically, this paper treats the modeling of covariance stationary vector-valued (i.e., multivariate) time series via an extension of the exponential model for the spectrum of a scalar time series. We discuss the modeling advantages of the vector exponential model and its computational facets, such as how to obtain Wold coefficients from given cepstral coefficients. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approach through simulation as well as two illustrative data examples focusing on multi-step ahead forecasting and estimation of squared coherence.</span></p>

	abstract = {Databases often contain corrupted, degraded, and noisy data with duplicate entries across and within each database. Such problems arise in citations, medical databases, genetics, human rights databases, and a variety of other applied settings. The target of statistical inference can be viewed as an unsupervised problem of determining the edges of a bipartite graph that links the observed records to unobserved latent entities. Bayesian approaches provide attractive benefits, naturally providing uncertainty quantification via posterior probabilities. We propose a novel record linkage approach based on empirical Bayesian principles. Specifically, the empirical Bayesian--type step consists of taking the empirical distribution function of the data as the prior for the latent entities. This approach improves on the earlier HB approach not only by avoiding the prior specification problem but also by allowing both categorical and string-valued variables. Our extension to string-valued variables also involves the proposal of a new probabilistic mechanism by which observed record values for string fields can deviate from the values of their associated latent entities. Categorical fields that deviate from their corresponding true value are simply drawn from the empirical distribution function. We apply our proposed methodology to a simulated data set of German names and an Italian household survey, showing our method performs favorably compared to several standard methods in the literature. We also consider the robustness of our methods to changes in the hyper-parameters.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new data infrastructure for measuring economic activity. The infrastructure records transactions and account balances, yielding measurements with scope and accuracy that have little precedent in economics. The data are drawn from a diverse population that overrepresents males and younger adults but contains large numbers of underrepresented groups. The data infrastructure permits evaluation of a benchmark theory in economics that predicts that individuals should use a combination of cash management, saving, and borrowing to make the timing of income irrelevant for the timing of spending. As in previous studies and in contrast to the predictions of the theory, there is a response of spending to the arrival of anticipated income. The data also show, however, that this apparent excess sensitivity of spending results largely from the coincident timing of regular income and regular spending. The remaining excess sensitivity is concentrated among individuals with less liquidity.

	chapter = {375},
	abstract = {<p>Many statistical agencies, survey organizations, and research centers collect data that suffer from item nonresponse and erroneous or inconsistent values. These data may be required to satisfy linear constraints, for example, bounds on individual variables and inequalities for ratios or sums of variables. Often these constraints are designed to identify faulty values, which then are blanked and imputed. The data also may exhibit complex distributional features, including nonlinear relationships and highly nonnormal distributions. We present a fully Bayesian, joint model for modeling or imputing data with missing/blanked values under linear constraints that (i) automatically incorporates the constraints in inferences and imputations, and (ii) uses a flexible Dirichlet process mixture of multivariate normal distributions to reflect complex distributional features. Our strategy for estimation is to augment the observed data with draws from a hypothetical population in which the constraints are not present, thereby taking advantage of computationally expedient methods for fitting mixture models. Missing/blanked items are sampled from their posterior distribution using the Hit-and-Run sampler, which guarantees that all imputations satisfy the constraints. We illustrate the approach using manufacturing data from Colombia, examining the potential to preserve joint distributions and a regression from the plant productivity literature.

	abstract = {A New Method for Protecting Interrelated Time Series with Bayesian Prior Distributions and Synthetic Data Schneider, Matthew J.; Abowd, John M. Organizations disseminate statistical summaries of administrative data via the Web for unrestricted public use. They balance the trade-off between confidentiality protection and inference quality. Recent developments in disclosure avoidance techniques include the incorporation of synthetic data, which capture the essential features of underlying data by releasing altered data generated from a posterior predictive distribution. The United States Census Bureau collects millions of interrelated time series micro-data that are hierarchical and contain many zeros and suppressions. Rule-based disclosure avoidance techniques often require the suppression of count data for small magnitudes and the modification of data based on a small number of entities. Motivated by this problem, we use zero-inflated extensions of Bayesian Generalized Linear Mixed Models (BGLMM) with privacy-preserving prior distributions to develop methods for protecting and releasing synthetic data from time series about thousands of small groups of entities without suppression based on the of magnitudes or number of entities. We find that as the prior distributions of the variance components in the BGLMM become more precise toward zero, confidentiality protection increases and inference quality deteriorates. We evaluate our methodology using a strict privacy measure, empirical differential privacy, and a newly defined risk measure, Probability of Range Identification (PoRI), which directly measures attribute disclosure risk. We illustrate our results with the U.S. Census Bureau{\textquoteright}s Quarterly Workforce Indicators.},

	abstract = {Reducing Uncertainty in the American Community Survey through Data-Driven Regionalization Spielman, Seth; Folch, David The American Community Survey (ACS) is the largest US survey of households and is the principal source for neighborhood scale information about the US population and economy. The ACS is used to allocate billions in federal spending and is a critical input to social scientific research in the US. However, estimates from the ACS can be highly unreliable. For example, in over 72\% of census tracts the estimated number of children under 5 in poverty has a margin of error greater than the estimate. Uncertainty of this magnitude complicates the use of social data in policy making, research, and governance. This article develops a spatial optimization algorithm that is capable of reducing the margins of error in survey data via the creation of new composite geographies, a process called regionalization. Regionalization is a complex combinatorial problem. Here rather than focusing on the technical aspects of regionalization we demonstrate how to use a purpose built open source regionalization algorithm to post-process survey data in order to reduce the margins of error to some user-specified threshold.},

We test Shimer{\textquoteright}s (2005) theory of the sorting of workers between and within industrial sectors based on directed search with coordination frictions, deliberately maintaining its static general equilibrium framework. We fit the model to sector-specific wage, vacancy and output data, including publicly-available statistics that characterize the distribution of worker and employer wage heterogeneity across sectors. Our empirical method is general and can be applied to a broad class of assignment models. The results indicate that industries are the loci of sorting-more productive workers are employed in more productive industries. The evidence confirms that strong assortative matching can be present even when worker and employer components of wage heterogeneity are weakly correlated.},

The U.S. Census Bureau{\textquoteright}s American Community Survey (ACS) is the foundation of social science research, much federal resource allocation and the development of public policy and private sector decisions. However, the high uncertainty associated with some of the ACS{\textquoteright}s most frequently used estimates can jeopardize the accuracy of inferences based on these data. While there is high level understanding in the research community that problems exist in the data, the sources and implications of these problems have been largely overlooked. Using 2006-2010 ACS median household income at the census tract scale as the test case (where a third of small-area estimates have higher than recommend errors), we explore the patterns in the uncertainty of ACS data. We consider various potential sources of uncertainty in the data, ranging from response level to geographic location to characteristics of the place. We find that there exist systematic patterns in the uncertainty in both the spatial and attribute dimensions. Using a regression framework, we identify the factors that are most frequently correlated with the error at national, regional and metropolitan area scales, and find these correlates are not consistent across the various locations tested. The implication is that data quality varies in different places, making cross-sectional analysis both within and across regions less reliable. We also present general advice for data users and potential solutions to the challenges identified.},

	journal = {Unpublished manuscript, University of Michigan. Accessed May},
	volume = {6},

	abstract = {This paper describes a method to calculate income and payroll taxes from Panel Study of Income Dynamics data using the NBER's Internet TAXSIM version 9 (http://users.nber.org/~taxsim/taxsim9/), for PSID survey years 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005. 2007, 2009, and 2011 (tax years n-1). These methods are implemented in two Stata programs, designed to be used with the PSID public-use zipped Main Interview data files: PSID\_TAXSIM\_1of2.do and PSID\_TAXSIM\_2of2.do. The main program (2of2) was written by Sara Kimberlin (skimberlin@berkeley.edu) and generates all TAXSIM input variables, runs TAXSIM, adjusts tax estimates using additional information available in PSID data, and calculates total PSID family unit taxes. A separate program (1of2) was written by Jiyoon (June) Kim (junekim@umich.edu) in collaboration with Luke Shaefer (lshaefer@umich.edu) to calculate mortgage interest for itemized deductions; this program needs to be run first, before the main program. Jonathan Latner contributed code to use the programs with the PSID zipped data. The overall methods build on the strategy for using TAXSIM with PSID data outlined by Butrica \& Burkhauser (1997), with some expansions and modifications. Note that the methods described below are designed to prioritize accuracy of income taxes calculated for low-income households, particularly refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Additional Child Tax Credit. Income tax liability is generally low for low-income households, and the amount of refundable tax credits is often substantially larger than tax liabilities for this population. Payroll tax can also be substantial for low-income households. Thus the methods below focus on maximizing accuracy of income tax and payroll tax calculations for low-income families, with less attention to tax items that largely impact higher-income households (e.g. the treatment of capital gains).},

	abstract = {We propose an unsupervised approach for linking records across arbitrarily many files, while simultaneously detecting duplicate records within files. Our key innovation involves the representation of the pattern of links between records as a bipartite graph, in which records are directly linked to latent true individuals, and only indirectly linked to other records. This flexible representation of the linkage structure naturally allows us to estimate the attributes of the unique observable people in the population, calculate transitive linkage probabilities across records (and represent this visually), and propagate the uncertainty of record linkage into later analyses. Our method makes it particularly easy to integrate record linkage with post-processing procedures such as logistic regression, capture-recapture, etc. Our linkage structure lends itself to an efficient, linear-time, hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which overcomes many obstacles encountered by previously record linkage approaches, despite the high-dimensional parameter space. We illustrate our method using longitudinal data from the National Long Term Care Survey and with data from the Italian Survey on Household and Wealth, where we assess the accuracy of our method and show it to be better in terms of error rates and empirical scalability than other approaches in the literature.

We consider a general framework for nonparametric Bayes joint modeling through mixture models that incorporate dependence across data types through a joint mixing measure. The mixing measure is assigned a novel infinite tensor factorization (ITF) prior that allows flexible dependence in cluster allocation across data types. The ITF prior is formulated as a tensor product of stick-breaking processes. Focusing on a convenient special case corresponding to a Parafac factorization, we provide basic theory justifying the flexibility of the proposed prior and resulting asymptotic properties. Focusing on ITF mixtures of product kernels, we develop a new Gibbs sampling algorithm for routine implementation relying on slice sampling. The methods are compared with alternative joint mixture models based on Dirichlet processes and related approaches through simulations and real data applications.</span></p>

	abstract = {Bayesian multiple imputation for large-scale categorical data with structural zeros Manrique-Vallier, D.; Reiter, J. P. We propose an approach for multiple imputation of items missing at random in large-scale surveys with exclusively categorical variables that have structural zeros. Our approach is to use mixtures of multinomial distributions as imputation engines, accounting for structural zeros by conceiving of the observed data as a truncated sample from a hypothetical population without structural zeros. This approach has several appealing features: imputations are generated from coherent, Bayesian joint models that automatically capture complex dependencies and readily scale to large numbers of variables. We outline a Gibbs sampling algorithm for implementing the approach, and we illustrate its potential with a repeated sampling study using public use census microdata from the state of New York, USA.},

The recent work [26, 32] demonstrated a potential use of b-bit minwise hashing [23, 24] for efficient search and learning on massive, high-dimensional, binary data (which are typical for many applications in Web search and text mining). In this paper, we focus on a number of critical issues which must be addressed before one can apply b-bit minwise hashing to the volumes of data often used industrial applications. Minwise hashing requires an expensive preprocessing step that computes k (e.g., 500) minimal values after applying the corresponding permutations for each data vector. We developed a parallelization scheme using GPUs and observed that the preprocessing time can be reduced by a factor of 20 ~ 80 and becomes substantially smaller than the data loading time. Reducing the preprocessing time is highly beneficial in practice, e.g., for duplicate Web page detection (where minwise hashing is a major step in the crawling pipeline) or for increasing the testing speed of online classifiers. Another critical issue is that for very large data sets it becomes impossible to store a (fully) random permutation matrix, due to its space requirements. Our paper is the first study to demonstrate that b-bit minwise hashing implemented using simple hash functions, e.g., the 2-universal (2U) and 4-universal (4U) hash families, can produce very similar learning results as using fully random permutations. Experiments on datasets of up to 200GB are presented.},

	abstract = {Credible interval estimates for official statistics with survey nonresponse Manski, Charles F. Government agencies commonly report official statistics based on survey data as point estimates, without accompanying measures of error. In the absence of agency guidance, users of the statistics can only conjecture the error magnitudes. Agencies could mitigate misinterpretation of official statistics if they were to measure potential errors and report them. Agencies could report sampling error using established statistical principles. It is more challenging to report nonsampling errors because there are many sources of such errors and there has been no consensus about how to measure them. To advance discourse on practical ways to report nonsampling error, this paper considers error due to survey nonresponse. I summarize research deriving interval estimates that make no assumptions about the values of missing data. In the absence of assumptions, one can obtain computable bounds on the population parameters that official statistics intend to measure. I also explore the middle ground between interval estimation making no assumptions and traditional point estimation using weights and imputations to implement assumptions that nonresponse is conditionally random. I am grateful to Aanchal Jain for excellent research assistance and to Bruce Spencer for helpful discussions. I have benefitted from the opportunity to present this work in a seminar at the Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Essex.},

This study uses the Survey of Income and Program Participation{\textquoteright}s topical modules on Assets and Liabilities to examine associations between the EITC expansions during the early 1990s and the unsecured debt of the households of single mothers. We use two difference-in-differences comparisons over the study period 1988-1999, first comparing single mothers to single childless women, and then comparing single mothers with two or more children to single mothers with exactly one child. In both cases we find that the EITC expansions are associated with a relative decline in the unsecured debt of affected households of single mothers. While not direct evidence of a causal relationship, this is suggestive evidence that single mothers may have used part of their EITC to limit the growth of their unsecured debt during this period.</p>

Leveraging these linkages is an essential aspect of {\textquotedblleft}big data{\textquotedblright} scholarship. However, the utility of these confidential data for scholarship is compromised by the complex nature of their management and curation.

We describe in this paper our work on the CED2AR prototype, a first step in providing researchers with a tool that spans the confidential/publicly-accessible divide, making it possible for researchers to identify, search, access, and cite those data. The particular points of interest in our work are the cloaking of metadata fields and the expression of provenance chains. For the former, we make use of existing fields in the DDI (Data Description Initiative) specification and suggest some minor changes to the specification. For the latter problem, we investigate the integration of DDI with recent work by the W3C PROV working group that has developed a generalizable and extensible model for expressing data provenance.},

following workers in administrative data after mass layoffs under the presumption that these are

this paper examines this presumption by matching worker-supplied reasons for separations with
what is happening at the firm. The paper documents substantially different earnings dynamics
in mass layoffs depending on the reason the worker gives for the separation. Using a new methodology
for accounting for the increase in the probability of separation among all types of survey
response during in a mass layoff, the paper finds earnings loss estimates that are surprisingly
close to those using only administrative data. Finally, the survey-administrative link allows the
decomposition of earnings losses due to subsequent nonemployment into non-participation and
unemployment. Including the zero earnings of those identified as being unemployed substantially
increases the estimate of earnings losses.},

We have built Ringtail, a nowcasting system that helps the user by automatically suggesting high-quality signals. We demonstrate that Ringtail can make nowcasting easier by suggesting relevant features for a range of topics. The user provides just a short topic query (e.g., unemployment) and a small conventional dataset in order for Ringtail to quickly return a usable predictive nowcasting model.},

Extreme poverty is defined using a World Bank metric of global poverty: \$2 or less, per person, per day. Using the 1996-2008 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we estimate that in mid-2011, 1.65 million households with 3.55 million children were living in extreme poverty in a given month, based on cash income, constituting 4.3 percent of all nonelderly households with children. The prevalence of extreme poverty has risen sharply since 1996, particularly among those most affected by the 1996 welfare reform. Adding SNAP benefits to household income reduces the number of extremely poor households with children by 48.0 percent in mid-2011. Adding SNAP, refundable tax credits, and housing subsidies reduces it by 62.8 percent.},

	title = {Some Recent Advances in Non- and Semiparametric Bayesian Modeling with Copulas, Mixtures, and Latent Variables (Ph.D. Thesis)},
	year = {2013},
	school = {Duke University},
	type = {Ph.D.},
	abstract = {This thesis develops flexible non- and semiparametric Bayesian models for mixed continuous, ordered and unordered categorical data. These methods have a range of possible applications; the applications considered in this thesis are drawn primarily from the social sciences, where multivariate, heterogeneous datasets with complex dependence and missing observations are the norm.

The first contribution is an extension of the Gaussian factor model to Gaussian copula factor models, which accommodate continuous and ordinal data with unspecified marginal distributions. I describe how this model is the most natural extension of the Gaussian factor model, preserving its essential dependence structure and the interpretability of factor loadings and the latent variables. I adopt an approximate likelihood for posterior inference and prove that, if the Gaussian copula model is true, the approximate posterior distribution of the copula correlation matrix asymptotically converges to the correct parameter under nearly any marginal distributions. I demonstrate with simulations that this method is both robust and efficient, and illustrate its use in an application from political science.

The second contribution is a novel nonparametric hierarchical mixture model for continuous, ordered and unordered categorical data. The model includes a hierarchical prior used to couple component indices of two separate models, which are also linked by local multivariate regressions. This structure effectively overcomes the limitations of existing mixture models for mixed data, namely the overly strong local independence assumptions. In the proposed model local independence is replaced by local conditional independence, so that the induced model is able to more readily adapt to structure in the data. I demonstrate the utility of this model as a default engine for multiple imputation of mixed data in a large repeated-sampling study using data from the Survey of Income and Participation. I show that it improves substantially on its most popular competitor, multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE), while enjoying certain theoretical properties that MICE lacks.

The third contribution is a latent variable model for density regression. Most existing density regression models are quite flexible but somewhat cumbersome to specify and fit, particularly when the regressors are a combination of continuous and categorical variables. The majority of these methods rely on extensions of infinite discrete mixture models to incorporate covariate dependence in mixture weights, atoms or both. I take a fundamentally different approach, introducing a continuous latent variable which depends on covariates through a parametric regression. In turn, the observed response depends on the latent variable through an unknown function. I demonstrate that a spline prior for the unknown function is quite effective relative to Dirichlet Process mixture models in density estimation settings (i.e., without covariates) even though these Dirichlet process mixtures have better theoretical properties asymptotically. The spline formulation enjoys a number of computational advantages over more flexible priors on functions. Finally, I demonstrate the utility of this model in regression applications using a dataset on U.S. wages from the Census Bureau, where I estimate the return to schooling as a smooth function of the quantile index.},

	abstract = {Asymptotic Theory of Cepstral Random Fields McElroy, T.S.; Holan, S.H. Random fields play a central role in the analysis of spatially correlated data and, as a result,have a significant impact on a broad array of scientific applications. Given the importance of this topic, there has been a substantial amount of research devoted to this area. However, the cepstral random field model remains largely underdeveloped outside the engineering literature. We provide a comprehensive treatment of the asymptotic theory for two-dimensional random field models. In particular, we provide recursive formulas that connect the spatial cepstral coefficients to an equivalent moving-average random field, which facilitates easy computation of the necessary autocovariance matrix. Additionally, we establish asymptotic consistency results for Bayesian, maximum likelihood, and quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of random field parameters and regression parameters. Further, in both the maximum and quasi-maximum likelihood frameworks, we derive the asymptotic distribution of our estimator. The theoretical results are presented generally and are of independent interest,pertaining to a wide class of random field models. The results for the cepstral model facilitate model-building: because the cepstral coefficients are unconstrained in practice, numerical optimization is greatly simplified, and we are always guaranteed a positive definite covariance matrix. We show that inference for individual coefficients is possible, and one can refine models in a disciplined manner. Finally, our results are illustrated through simulation and the analysis of straw yield data in an agricultural field experiment. http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.1977.pdf},

	abstract = {Data Management of Confidential Data Lagoze, Carl; Block, William C.; Williams, Jeremy; Abowd, John M.; Vilhuber, Lars Social science researchers increasingly make use of data that is confidential because it contains linkages to the identities of people, corporations, etc. The value of this data lies in the ability to join the identifiable entities with external data such as genome data, geospatial information, and the like. However, the confidentiality of this data is a barrier to its utility and curation, making it difficult to fulfill US federal data management mandates and interfering with basic scholarly practices such as validation and reuse of existing results. We describe the complexity of the relationships among data that span a public and private divide. We then describe our work on the CED2AR prototype, a first step in providing researchers with a tool that spans this divide and makes it possible for them to search, access, and cite that data.},

The current internal name for our DDI-based system is the Comprehensive Extensible Data Documentation and Access Repository (CED{\texttwosuperior}AR). CED{\texttwosuperior}AR ingests metadata from heterogeneous sources and supports filtered synchronization between restricted and public metadata holdings. Currently-supported CED{\texttwosuperior}AR {\textquotedblleft}connector workflows{\textquotedblright} include mechanisms to ingest IPUMS, zero-observation files from the American Community Survey (DDI 2.1), and SIPP Synthetic Beta (DDI 1.2). These disparate metadata sources are all transformed into a DDI 2.5 compliant form and stored in a single repository. In addition, we will demonstrate an extension to DDI 2.5 that allows for the labeling of elements within the schema to indicate confidentiality. This metadata can then be filtered, allowing the creation of derived public use metadata from an original confidential source. This repository is currently searchable online through a prototype application demonstrating the ability to search across previously heterogeneous metadata sources.

	abstract = {Encoding Provenance Metadata for Social Science Datasets Lagoze, Carl; Williams, Jeremy; Vilhuber, Lars Recording provenance is a key requirement for data-centric scholarship, allowing researchers to evaluate the integrity of source data sets and re- produce, and thereby, validate results. Provenance has become even more critical in the web environment in which data from distributed sources and of varying integrity can be combined and derived. Recent work by the W3C on the PROV model provides the foundation for semantically-rich, interoperable, and web-compatible provenance metadata. We apply that model to complex, but characteristic, provenance examples of social science data, describe scenarios that make scholarly use of those provenance descriptions, and propose a manner for encoding this provenance metadata within the widely-used DDI metadata standard.

We use the Survey of Income and ProgramParticipation (SIPP) to examine a series of measures of householdmaterial hardship thatwere collected in the years 1992, 1995, 1998, 2003 and 2005.We stratify our sample to differentiate between the 1) deeply poor (b50\% of poverty), who sawa decline in public assistance over this period; and two groups that sawsome forms of public assistance increase: 2) other poor households (50-99\% of poverty), and 3) the near poor (100-150\% of poverty). We report bivariate trends over the study period, as well as presenting multivariate difference-indifferences estimates.We find suggestive evidence that material hardship{\textemdash}in the form of difficulty meeting essential household expenses, and falling behind on utilities costs{\textemdash}has generally increased among the deeply poor but has remained roughly the same for the middle group (50-99\% of poverty), and decreased among the near poor (100-150\% of poverty). Multivariate difference-in-differences estimates suggest that these trends have resulted in intensified stratification of the material well-being of low-income households with children.</p>

The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable credit for low-income workers that is mainly targeted at families with children. This study uses the Survey of Income and Program Participation{\textquoteright}s (SIPP) topical modules on Assets \&amp; Liabilities to examine the effects of EITC expansions during the early 1990s on the unsecured debt of the households of single mothers. We use two difference-in-differences comparisons over the study period 1988 to 1999, first comparing single mothers to single childless women, and then comparing single mothers with two or more children to single mothers with exactly one child. In both cases we find that the EITC expansions are associated with a relative decline in the unsecured debt of affected households of single mothers. This suggests that single mothers may have used part of their EITC to limit the growth of their unsecured debt during this period.},

	abstract = {Estimating identification disclosure risk using mixed membership models Manrique-Vallier, Daniel; Reiter, Jerome Statistical agencies and other organizations that disseminate data are obligated to protect data subjects{\textquoteright} confi dentiality. For example, ill-intentioned individuals might link data subjects to records in other databases by matching on common characteristics (keys). Successful links are particularly problematic for data subjects with combinations of keys that are unique in the population. Hence, as part of their assessments of disclosure risks, many data stewards estimate the probabilities that sample uniques on sets of discrete keys are also population uniques on those keys. This is typically done using log-linear modeling on the keys. However, log-linear models can yield biased estimates of cell probabilities for sparse contingency tables with many zero counts, which often occurs in databases with many keys. This bias can result in unreliable estimates of probabilities of uniqueness and, hence, misrepresentations of disclosure risks. We propose an alternative to log-linear models for datasets with sparse keys based on a Bayesian version of grade of membership (GoM) models. We present a Bayesian GoM model for multinomial variables and off er an MCMC algorithm for fitting the model. We evaluate the approach by treating data from a recent US Census Bureau public use microdata sample as a population, taking simple random samples from that population, and benchmarking estimated probabilities of uniqueness against population values. Compared to log-linear models, GoM models provide more accurate estimates of the total number of uniques in the samples. Additionally, they offer record-level predictions of uniqueness that dominate those based on log-linear models.},

This model has been challenged on several fronts, including the absence of parallel linkages across pathways. Calendar survey interviewing shows the frequent and varied use of parallel associations in autobiographical recall. Parallel associations in these data are commonplace, and are driven more by respondents{\textquoteright} generative retrieval than by interviewers{\textquoteright} probing. Parallel associations represent a number of autobiographical knowledge themes that are interrelated across life domains. The content of parallel associations is nearly evenly split between general and transitional events, supporting the importance of transitions in autographical memory. Associations in respondents{\textquoteright} memories (both parallel and sequential), demonstrate complex interactions with interviewer verbal behaviors during generative retrieval. In addition to discussing the implications of these results to the SMS model, implications are also drawn for transition theory and the basic-systems model.},

	journal = {Journal of the American Statistical Association},
	abstract = {The bipartite record linkage task consists of merging two disparate datafiles containing information on two overlapping sets of entities. This is non-trivial in the absence of unique identifiers and it is important for a wide variety of applications given that it needs to be solved whenever we have to combine information from different sources. Most statistical techniques currently used for record linkage are derived from a seminal paper by Fellegi and Sunter (1969). These techniques usually assume independence in the matching statuses of record pairs to derive estimation procedures and optimal point estimators. We argue that this independence assumption is unreasonable and instead target a bipartite matching between the two datafiles as our parameter of interest. Bayesian implementations allow us to quantify uncertainty on the matching decisions and derive a variety of point estimators using different loss functions. We propose partial Bayes estimates that allow uncertain parts of the bipartite matching to be left unresolved. We evaluate our approach to record linkage using a variety of challenging scenarios and show that it outperforms the traditional methodology. We illustrate the advantages of our methods merging two datafiles on casualties from the civil war of El Salvador.},

	volume = {11},
	pages = {340-361},
	abstract = {Prediction of aboveground biomass, particularly at large spatial scales, is necessary for estimating global-scale carbon sequestration. Since biomass can be measured only by sacrificing trees, total biomass on plots is never observed. Rather, allometric equations are used to convert individual tree diameter to individual biomass, perhaps with noise. The values for all trees on a plot are then summed to obtain a derived total biomass for the plot. Then, with derived total biomasses for a collection of plots, regression models, using appropriate environmental covariates, are employed to attempt explanation and prediction. Not surprisingly, when out-of-sample validation is examined, such a model will predict total biomass well for holdout data because it is obtained using exactly the same derived approach.

Apart from the somewhat circular nature of the regression approach, it also fails to employ the actual observed plot level response data. At each plot, we observe a random number of trees, each with an associated diameter, producing a sample of diameters. A model based on this random number of tree diameters provides understanding of how environmental regressors explain abundance of individuals, which in turn explains individual diameters.

We incorporate density dependence because the distribution of tree diameters over a plot of fixed size depends upon the number of trees on the plot. After fitting this model, we can obtain predictive distributions for individual-level biomass and plot-level total biomass. We show that predictive distributions for plot-level biomass obtained from a density-dependent model for diameters will be much different from predictive distributions using the regression approach. Moreover, they can be more informative for capturing uncertainty than those obtained from modeling derived plot-level biomass directly.

We develop a density-dependent diameter distribution model and illustrate with data from the national Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database. We also describe how to scale predictions to larger spatial regions. Our predictions agree (in magnitude) with available wisdom on mean and variation in biomass at the hectare scale.},

	abstract = {AbstractMultiple imputation is a common approach for dealing with missing values in statistical databases. The imputer fills in missing values with draws from predictive models estimated from the observed data, resulting in multiple, completed versions of the database. Researchers have developed a variety of default routines to implement multiple imputation; however, there has been limited research comparing the performance of these methods, particularly for categorical data. We use simulation studies to compare repeated sampling properties of three default multiple imputation methods for categorical data, including chained equations using generalized linear models, chained equations using classification and regression trees, and a fully Bayesian joint distribution based on Dirichlet Process mixture models. We base the simulations on categorical data from the American Community Survey. In the circumstances of this study, the results suggest that default chained equations approaches based on generalized linear models are dominated by the default regression tree and Bayesian mixture model approaches. They also suggest competing advantages for the regression tree and Bayesian mixture model approaches, making both reasonable default engines for multiple imputation of categorical data.

	abstract = {Spatio-temporal data and processes are prevalent across a wide variety of scientific disciplines. These processes are often characterized by nonlinear time dynamics that include interactions across multiple scales of spatial and temporal variability. The data sets associated with many of these processes are increasing in size due to advances in automated data measurement, management, and numerical simulator output. Non- linear spatio-temporal models have only recently seen interest in statistics, but there are many classes of such models in the engineering and geophysical sciences. Tradi- tionally, these models are more heuristic than those that have been presented in the statistics literature, but are often intuitive and quite efficient computationally. We show here that with fairly simple, but important, enhancements, the echo state net- work (ESN) machine learning approach can be used to generate long-lead forecasts of nonlinear spatio-temporal processes, with reasonable uncertainty quantification, and at only a fraction of the computational expense of a traditional parametric nonlinear spatio-temporal models.},
